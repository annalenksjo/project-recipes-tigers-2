# Build a Recipe website

> This week's project is to build a recipe page based on the [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) during the remote collaborative session.

During this week we will be having a remote collaborative session â€“ YAY! During those days we will practice our JavaScript and API skills a bit more. We will also practice working as a real team using GitHub. You will experience, first-hand, the issues and struggles that can occur when working together with code.

During the session, your team will be challenged to build a website that lists recipes  â€“ YUM ðŸ˜‹.

All data should be fetched from the [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api). Your page will be built based on the following design:

I decided to continue working on the project by my self to improve it.
